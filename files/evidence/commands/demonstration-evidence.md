||  i-0987654321  |         t2.micro         | running  | subnet-xyz789  |  vpc-def456          ||
|+----------------+---------------------------+----------+----------------+----------------------+|
```

**Visual Evidence**:

![EC2 Access Success](../evidence/screenshots/image-6.png)
*Screenshot showing successful EC2 instance enumeration from external system, demonstrating infrastructure reconnaissance capability*

### Access Analysis
#### Successful Operations
- ✅ **S3 Bucket Listing**: Can enumerate all S3 buckets in account
- ✅ **EC2 Instance Description**: Can list all EC2 instances and metadata
- ✅ **Cross-Region Access**: Commands work across AWS regions
- ✅ **External Access**: Works from attacker's personal Ubuntu system
- ✅ **Instance Access**: Also works from original compromised EC2

> ⚠️ **Critical**: This demonstrates how IAM role compromise can lead to persistent, remote access to AWS resources beyond the initial point of compromise.

- **Applied Policy**: Conditional deny for all actions
- **Condition**: `aws:TokenIssueTime` less than revocation timestamp
- **Effect**: Immediate block of all AWS API operations

## 🚫 Phase 5: Access Denied - Verifying Attack Neutralization

### External Attacker System (Blocked)

**Command Result**:
```bash
nantwi@ansible-controller:~$ aws s3 ls
Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
nantwi@ansible-controller:~$
```

**Visual Evidence**:

![Attacker Access Blocked](../evidence/screenshots/image-12.png)
*Screenshot confirming that stolen credentials no longer work on external attacker system*

### EC2 Instance Access (Also Blocked)

**Visual Evidence**:

![EC2 Instance Blocked](../evidence/screenshots/image-13.png)
*Screenshot showing that legitimate EC2 instances are also temporarily blocked due to conditional deny policy*

### Impact Assessment
- ✅ **Attacker Blocked**: Stolen credentials immediately unusable
- ⚠️ **Legitimate Services Affected**: EC2 instances also lose access temporarily
- ✅ **Surgical Precision**: Only affects credentials issued before revocation
- ✅ **Immediate Effect**: No waiting for credential expiration

> ✅ **Success**: Session revocation technique successfully neutralized the credential compromise threat.

## 🔄 Phase 6: Service Restoration - Bringing Services Back Online

### Instance Management Process

**Visual Evidence**:

![Instance Stop/Start Process](../evidence/screenshots/image-14.png)
*Screenshot showing EC2 instance stop/start process to trigger fresh role assumption*

### Instances Running

**Visual Evidence**:

![Instances in Running State](../evidence/screenshots/image-15.png)
*Screenshot confirming both EC2 instances are in running state after restart*

### Restored Access Verification

**Visual Evidence**:

![Legitimate Access Restored](../evidence/screenshots/image-16.png)
*Screenshot demonstrating that legitimate EC2 instances now have full AWS access restored*

### Attacker Still Blocked

**Visual Evidence**:

![Attacker Permanently Blocked](../evidence/screenshots/image-17.png)
*Screenshot confirming that the external attacker system remains permanently blocked*

### Recovery Timeline
- **T+0:00**: Incident detected and session revocation applied
- **T+0:01**: Attack neutralized (stolen credentials blocked)
- **T+0:02**: Instance stop initiated  
- **T+0:05**: Instances fully stopped
- **T+0:06**: Instance start initiated
- **T+0:10**: Instances running and accessible
- **T+0:11**: Session Manager access restored
- **T+0:12**: AWS API access verified
- **T+0:13**: Application functionality confirmed
- **Total Downtime**: ~6 minutes

### Technical Analysis
#### Why Recovery Works
1. **Fresh Role Assumption**: Stop/start triggers EC2 to re-assume IAM role
2. **New Token Issue Time**: Fresh credentials have timestamp AFTER revocation
3. **Condition Bypass**: New `aws:TokenIssueTime` > revocation timestamp
4. **Full Permissions**: Original role permissions remain intact

### Security Validation  
- ✅ **Legitimate Access**: Fully restored with all required permissions
- ✅ **Attack Blocked**: Stolen credentials remain permanently unusable
- ✅ **Service Continuity**: Minimal downtime (~6 minutes)
- ✅ **Zero False Positives**: No impact on other AWS resources
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Clear record of incident and response

> ✅ **Mission Accomplished**: Complete threat neutralization with minimal business impact and full service restoration.

## 🔍 Key Learning Points

### IAM Role Security Fundamentals
1. **Temporary Credentials Cannot Be Manually Revoked** - Standard invalidation doesn't work
2. **Metadata Service Vulnerability** - Compromised instances expose all role permissions  
3. **Location Independence** - Stolen credentials work from anywhere on the internet
4. **Shared Permissions Model** - All role assumers get identical access rights

### Session Revocation Technique
1. **Conditional Deny Policy** - Use `aws:TokenIssueTime` condition for surgical precision
2. **Explicit Deny Precedence** - Deny always overrides allow in IAM policy evaluation
3. **Timestamp-Based Control** - Revocation timestamp determines which credentials are blocked
4. **Non-Disruptive Recovery** - Legitimate users can re-assume role with fresh timestamps

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

This demonstration successfully proves that IAM role session revocation provides an effective, surgical response to credential compromise incidents. The visual evidence shows each step of the process, from initial attack through complete remediation.

The technique offers:
- **Immediate threat neutralization** (< 1 minute)
- **Minimal business disruption** (< 6 minutes downtime)
- **Complete attack prevention** (stolen credentials permanently blocked)
- **Scalable implementation** (works across any number of affected instances)

> **🎯 This comprehensive visual documentation validates that sophisticated credential theft attacks can be completely neutralized using proper AWS security features, achieving maximum security effectiveness with minimal business impact.**
