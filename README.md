## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a critical AWS security incident response technique: **IAM Role Session Revocation**. When EC2 instance credentials are compromised and leaked, this method allows security teams to neutralize the threat without disrupting legitimate services.

### What This Project Demonstrates

- **Real credential extraction** from EC2 instance metadata
- **Local credential usage** by an attacker on external systems  
- **Session revocation technique** using conditional deny policies
- **Service restoration** for legitimate users while keeping attackers locked out

## The Security Scenario

### Background
The Animals4Life organization runs animal blog websites on AWS EC2 instances. Each instance uses IAM roles for secure access to AWS services like S3 and CloudWatch. However, when an instance is compromised, the temporary credentials can be extracted and used from anywhere.

### The Problem
- **Temporary credentials cannot be manually canceled**
- **Changing role permissions affects ALL users of the role**
- **Deleting the role breaks ALL instances using it**
- **Leaked credentials remain valid until natural expiration (hours)**

### The Solution
Use **conditional deny policies** that block access for credentials issued before a specific timestamp, while allowing legitimate users to re-assume the role with fresh credentials.

## Infrastructure Architecture

The CloudFormation template deploys:
- **VPC** with dual-stack networking (IPv4/IPv6)
- **3 public subnets** across multiple availability zones
- **2 EC2 instances** running Animals4Life blog websites
- **IAM role** with S3 and EC2 read permissions
- **CloudWatch monitoring** with comprehensive logging
- **Security groups** with intentional vulnerabilities for demonstration

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with CloudFormation permissions
- Basic understanding of IAM roles and EC2
- SSH client or Session Manager access

### 1. Deploy Infrastructure
```bash
# Deploy the CloudFormation template
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name aws-security-role-invalidation \
  --template-body file://infrastructure/A4LHostingInc.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```
### 2. Follow the Demonstration
1. **[Evidence Documentation](evidence/commands/demonstration-evidence.md)** - Complete attack and response evidence
2. **[Visual Evidence](files/evidence/screenshots/)** - Screenshots of each phase
3. **[Technical Analysis](/docs/demonstration_guide.md)** - Detailed walkthrough

### 3. Clean Up
```bash
# Delete the CloudFormation stack
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name aws-security-role-invalidation
```

## Attack Simulation Results

### Credential Extraction (Successful)
```bash
# Extract role name from instance metadata
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/

A4L-InstanceRole-TDHLFluqhnhA

# Extract temporary credentials
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/A4L-InstanceRole-TDHLFluqhnhA
{
  "AccessKeyId": "ASIA****************G3WA",
  "SecretAccessKey": "bMJW************************************k+je", 
  "Token": "IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEMr//////////wEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJH...",
  "Expiration": "2025-07-22T07:50:38Z"
}
```

### Local Credential Usage (Successful)

```bash
# Configure stolen credentials on Ubuntu system
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIAZDHYX3ENS3KXG3WA
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=bMJWZGRd4bmetp1XAJHWyOYl3zeFZ+UAI2ZNk+je  
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEMr//////////wEaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJH...

# Test unauthorized access
$ aws s3 ls
2025-05-01 21:34:43 cf-templates-nu92qc9cc5d4-us-east-1

$ aws ec2 describe-instances --region us-east-1 --output table
# Successfully lists all EC2 instances
```

## Incident Response Results  

### Session Revocation (Applied)
- **Timestamp**: 2025-07-21 at 9:08 PM CDT  
- **Method**: IAM Console ‚Üí Role ‚Üí Revoke Active Sessions
- **Policy Applied**: Conditional deny for tokens issued before timestamp

### Impact Verification (Successful)

```bash
# Attacker credentials blocked
$ aws s3 ls
Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".

# EC2 instances also lose access (expected)
$ aws s3 ls  # From EC2 instance
AccessDenied
```

### Service Restoration (Successful)  
```bash
# After instance stop/start cycle
$ aws s3 ls  # From EC2 instance  
2025-05-01 21:34:43 cf-templates-nu92qc9cc5d4-us-east-1
# ‚úÖ Legitimate access restored

# Attacker still blocked (permanent)
$ aws s3 ls  # From attacker machine
Unable to locate credentials...
# ‚ùå Attack neutralized
```

## üîç Security Analysis

### Vulnerability Assessment
- **SSH Access**: Open to 0.0.0.0/0 (Intentional for demonstration)
- **Instance Metadata**: Accessible without IMDSv2 enforcement
- **IAM Permissions**: Broad read access to S3 and EC2
- **Network Placement**: Public subnets with direct internet access

### Threat Model  
- **Attack Vector**: Instance compromise ‚Üí credential extraction ‚Üí lateral movement
- **Impact**: Unauthorized access to S3 buckets and EC2 metadata
- **Likelihood**: High (if instance is compromised)
- **Detection**: CloudWatch logs show unusual API patterns

### Security Controls
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch agent collecting security logs
- **Logging**: Authentication attempts in `/var/log/secure`
- **Incident Response**: Session revocation capability
- **Recovery**: Non-disruptive service restoration

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Credential Extraction Time** | < 30 seconds | From compromised instance |
| **Attack Setup Time** | < 2 minutes | Environment variables on Ubuntu |
| **AWS Access Validation** | Immediate | S3 and EC2 API calls successful |
| **Session Revocation Time** | < 1 minute | Via IAM console |
| **Attack Neutralization** | Immediate | Credentials blocked instantly |
| **Service Restoration** | < 5 minutes | Instance stop/start cycle |
| **Credential Lifetime** | ~6.5 hours | Original expiration time |
